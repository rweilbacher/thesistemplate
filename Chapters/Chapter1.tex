\section{The key wants of safety-critical device manufacturers}
This list comprises the key wants that manufactures of safety-critical devices want to achieve. In an ideal world you could satisfy every want individually but in reality they have complex interactions and need to be carefully balanced. The specifics of these interactions will be explored, in more detail, later. These wants will be used to compare the existing architectures with the hypervisor architecture.

Additionally they are not equally strong for every device. Some devices might have less potential for causing damage and therefore need to adhere to less strict safety regulations. While others might be sold in a market where cost is practically irrelevant because there is only one seller and buyers are large governments. 


\subsection{Safety}
It is self-evident that safety is going to be a key want in the engineering process of safety-critical devices. A device that is considered safer is often going to have an edge over that of a competitor. Furthermore, a perfectly safe device protects the manufacturer from expensive lawsuits.

Because of this, it is often beneficial for the manufacturer to ensure higher safety than required. However, in terms of economic viability, there are even more critical wants, as will become clear in the next section.

\subsubsection{Regulatory compliance}
To protect the end-customer of safety-critical devices, most regulatory bodies implement rules that govern how safety-critical devices have to be engineered and what quality level they have to fulfill.
Failing to achieve this is even more costly than lawsuits, since it will disallow the manufacturer from selling the device in the first place. 

For most regulations it’s not just enough to prove that the end result has a high level of quality, the engineering process itself needs to be of high quality as well. This means that it is normally completely infeasible to make a device safe in the eyes of the law, if it has not been developed with this goal from the start.

\subsection{Lowest possible cost}
Ultimately every safety-critical device has to be economically viable, or at the very least be a good investment that provides returns another way. 
Therefore every other want needs to be realized with the pressure of cost in mind. However, it can be said that most of the other wants only aim to reduce cost or cost variance indirectly anyway. In that case the methods that realize them need to balance cost against how well they resolve the want.

Let’s examine two examples of what this balance typically looks like: Imagine a device with a complex GUI and touchscreen functionality. These functions are expensive to implement from scratch [source] but there are already implementations out there. Specifically Linux offers a lot of drivers and frameworks that can make the implementation of this much cheaper. 

If the touchscreen and GUI need to be inherently safe the manufacturer doesn’t have many options other than to implement and verify the functionality himself. But if the functionality ca beSo the manufacturer has multiple options:
